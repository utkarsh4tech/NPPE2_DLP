## Overview
The IndicTTS Deepfake Challenge is a competition focused on detecting AI-generated speech across 16 Indian languages. Participants must develop models that predict the probability of an audio sample being synthesized. Submissions will be evaluated based on the ROC-AUC score, and final rankings will be determined using a private leaderboard. This challenge aims to advance research in TTS deepfake detection, ensuring more robust and reliable audio authentication systems.

## Description
The IndicTTS Deepfake Challenge is a competition designed for students to test and enhance their machine learning skills in speech deepfake detection. The challenge involves analyzing 33,737 audio samples spanning 16 Indian languages, including Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Sanskrit, Nepali, English, Telugu, Hindi, Odia, Manipuri, Gujarati, and Tamil.

Participants must develop models that predict the probability of an audio sample being AI-generated. The evaluation metric for this challenge is the ROC-AUC score, with final rankings determined by a private leaderboard.

With over 63 hours of audio, this competition provides a unique opportunity to work on real-world TTS deepfake detectionâ€”a critical area in AI security and speech synthesis research. Students will gain hands-on experience in audio processing, machine learning, and model evaluation, contributing to the advancement of reliable speech verification systems.

## Tips

- Do not overfit for the public dashboard.
- You do not even need the entire dataset for getting good results, fewer rows are enough.
- Use GPU hours smartly.
